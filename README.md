### My name is Joao Paulo and i'm try to make art in programming world, while the code drives me crazy because i forget a semicolon. Sometimes I get too focused on work, but i really like making people around me laugh, well, laughing is the best way to compile our problems and made then look like an ease-in-out transition. Once a little 11 years old boy said "I want to create games", so let's create our own games and make it worth, because this is the real art.
